# PRODIGY_BE_02
This project, part of my Prodigy Infotech Internship, demonstrates a REST API built with FastAPI. It includes user CRUD operations, Pydantic validation, error handling, SQLAlchemy ORM for persistence, Alembic migrations, dotenv configuration, and a clean architecture with routers, models, and schemas.
